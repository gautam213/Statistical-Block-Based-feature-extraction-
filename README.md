Feature extraction using Wavelet transform and Block Based Statistics

Computer Aided Diagnosis of Breast Cancer using Discrete Wavelet tranform and Statistical Block Based Feature Extraction.
Discrete Wavelet Transform(at 1st level only) of images is calculated which results in 4 subband of original images namely
Approximation, horizontal detail, vertical detail and diagonal detail coefficients respectively, Horizontal refers to array axis 0.
Then Block Based Stastical Properties is calculated for each subband with variable window size
